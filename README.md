## AI Disclosure

This project was built with and continues to use AI assistance. As a solo developer who's still learning, AI makes it possible to tackle a project of this scope — something that would otherwise require a team. It's a personal project, and AI is a tool that helps bridge the gap between ambition and experience. It's not perfect, but neither am I. We believe in being upfront about how this project is built.
